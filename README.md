# Project - Feed Reader Testing

## Description
A web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.

## How to Run

Download or clone  this respository, uncompress, and then open the `index.html` in your favorite browser. The test results are shown in the bottom of the page.
